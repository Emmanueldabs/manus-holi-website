<h1 class="heading">Holi celebrations in Bengal</h1>
<div class="content">
  There is a particular elan in the way Holi is celebrated in the state of West Bengal. Panache is added by the presence of the rich Bengal culture and the existence of Shantiniketan.

  Basant Utsav
  The high point of this state is the celebration of 'Basant Utsav'. The tradition was reintroduced by poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore at Shantiniketan, the University he founded. 'Basant Utsav' means 'Spring Festival', here boys and girls joyfully welcome Spring, the season of Hope not just with colours but with songs, dance, chanting of hymns in the serene ambiance of Shantiniketan.
  
  Dol Purnima
  On the Dol Purnima day in the early morning, the students dress up in saffron-coloured clothes and wear garlands of fragrant flowers. They sing and dance to the accompaniment of musical instruments presenting an enchanting view to the onlookers and a memory to cherish for years.
  
  In Bengal, Holi is known by the name of 'Dol Jatra', 'Dol Purnima' or the 'Swing Festival'. The festival is celebrated in a dignified manner by placing the idols of Krishna and Radha on a picturesquely decorated palanquin which is then taken round the main streets of the city. The devotees take turns to swing them while women dance around the swing and sing devotional songs. All this while men keep spraying coloured water and colour powder, 'abeer' at them.</div>
  <h1 class="heading">Holi celebrations in Delhi</h1>
  <div class="content">We all know Delhi as the capital of India. It's New Delhi, to be certain. It is the cultural tradition of India. It is the unparalleled city of India which has stood the test of time, to historic battles, convulsions, and formations and so on. It is the place of Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Presidents house. It houses the 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, the residence of the Indian Prime Minister. It is the place of intriguing relics like Purana Qila, National Museum, Jama Masjid, Chandni Chowk, Qutab Minar, Swaminarayan Akshardham Temple, Lodhi Gardens, Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb and so on.</div>
  <h1 class="heading">Holi celebrations in Punjab</h1>
  <div class="content">Known for their love for life, Sikhs celebrate Holi in their own style and elan. At Punjab, they call it 'Hola Mohalla'. They shout, and shout their hearts out following a peculiar tradition. Besides, they also exhibit their martial arts specially 'kushti' on this day and make merry with the colours in the evening. Mouthwatering halwas, puris, gujias, a preparation of raw jack fruit and malpuas are of course, an essential part of the festivities. The only difference is that they do not light a bonfire.

    Hola Mohalla
    Holla Mohalla is celebrated a day after Holi in Punjab especially by the Nihang Sikhs.
    The festival is celebrated with gusto at Anandpur Sahib for it was here that Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth and last guru, instituted the pahul (baptism of the Khalsas), elected the panj pyare (the beloved five), and militarized his followers into the order of Nihangs (warrior-mendicants).
    
    This festival of the Nihangs held at their headquarters Anandpur Sahib began as a counterpart to Holi. Though it almost did away with the throwing of colors, nonetheless, it is more colorful.
    
    Martial arts like archery, sword fencing, fancy horse-riding, tent-pegging, and the deft handling of other contraptions of offence and defense are displayed by the Nihangs. Spectacular and thrilling acts of dare-devilry dexterously executed are performed.</div>
